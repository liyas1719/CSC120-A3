- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? nina, sofia, nimco
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? tuesday 7-9pm
- What are your initial impressions of Java? it is quite tough i think. it is very different from python and it isn't always clear what the errors are or why or how to fix them.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? its definetly all about a set of steps and folling your code through can make it make more sense
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? 
i really wish that this assignment had been to convert existing python code to java instead of having to generate our own on top of trying out a new language. i think certainly go to ta hours but i really felt like this assignment was way outside of my capabilities and i spent so much time just trying to figure out formatting that i didn't even have time to think about how i wanted the code to run.
